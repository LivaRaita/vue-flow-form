# Guide

## Files/folders:

* **CSS**: src/assets/css, examples/*example-name*/branding.css
* **Vue components**: src/components, src/components/QuestionTypes
* **Models**: src/models

## Usage (examples in examples/*example-name*/Example.vue):

* Set corresponding JavaScript entry file in vue.config.js    

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    publicPath: '',
    pages: {
      index: {
        entry: 'examples/questionnaire/main.js', // Replace with your .js entry file path
        template: 'public/index.html',
        filename: 'index.html'
      }
    }
  }
  ```
* Import necessary components and classes
* Create question list
* Add `Survey` component
  * Add the question list as `questions` prop
  * Add language model as `language` prop (optional)
    * language is defined by creating a new instance of `LanguageModel` and setting its properties
  * add `submit` and/or `complete` event listeners if you want to submit data to the backend

## Included examples:

* Questionnaire (default):
  * example containing a sample questionnaire
* Quiz:
  * example showing how the component can be used in a more advanced way
  * this example shows the number of correctly answered questions after submitting the form, along with an accompanying message
  * to view this example, change the entry point in vue.config.js to `'examples/quiz/main.js'`

## Question types:

* Text - `QuestionType.Text`
* LongText (Textarea) - `QuestionType.LongText`
* Number - `QuestionType.Number`
* Email - `QuestionType.Email`
* Phone - `QuestionType.Phone`
* URL - `QuestionType.Url`
* Dropdown (Select) - `QuestionType.Dropdown`
* MultipleChoice - `QuestionType.MultipleChoice`
* SectionBreak - `QuestionType.SectionBreak`

## Defining questions:

* Create a new instance of `QuestionModel`
  * `type` - (one of `QuestionType` constants above)
  * `id` - id of the question (optional but necessary when using `jump`)
  * `question` - text of the question
  * `title` - text above the question (optional)
  * `subtitle` - text below question (optional)
  * `description` - text below HTML input (optional)
  * `content` - HTML, used only with SectionBreak
    * can be either a raw HTML string or a render function
    * if passing a render function, it needs to have `h` as the first argument, eg.:    

      ```js
      content: function(h) {
        return <div> ... </div>
      }
      ```
  * `required` - is field required or not (true/false - default is false)
    * turn on/off the `required` asterisk next to the question in vue-form/src/assets/css/common.css:    

      ```css
      .f-required {
        display: inline; /* or display: none; to turn off */
      }     
      ```    
  * `options` - `ChoiceOption` array (used only with Dropdown and MultipleChoice)
    * `ChoiceOption` must have a `label` defined (this is what will be shown to the user)
    * if `value` is not defined, `label` will be used
  * `inline` - if true, displays the field next to the question, used only with Dropdown (true/false - default is false)
  * `placeholder` - define custom placeholder for the input fields
    * if not defined, the default value from LanguageModel will be used 
  * `mask` - number input mask, used only with Phone (optional)
  * `helpText` - help text, used only with LongText and MultipleChoice (optional)
    * if not defined, the default values from LanguageModel will be used (multipleChoiceHelpText for MultipleChoice and longTextHelpText for LongText)
  * `multiple` - used only with MultipleChoice, defines if multiple answers can be chosen (true/false - default is false)
  * `allowOther` - used only with MultipleChoice, adds custom text field to the MultipleChoice selection
  * `jump` - define which question to jump to after answering (function or object)
    * **function**: it will get the question model as the only parameter and must return the id to jump to
    * **object**: must define object with possible answer values and jump IDs, eg.:    
    
      ```js
      {
        a: 'jump_a',
        b: 'jump_b',
        c: '_submit',
        _other: 'jump_other'
      }
      ```
      Object key `_other` will be used when no other keys match the answer. Object value `_submit` will jump to form submit button

## Survey component events:

* `complete` - emitted whenever the "completed" status changes, the first parameter is the status, the second is the question list, eg.:    

  ```js
  function onComplete(completed, questionList) {
    // Handle status change.
  }
  ```
  If the user completes the form, then goes back and changes any of the answers to make them invalid, this event will again be called
  with `false` as the first parameter, so make sure to handle this correctly in your app.
* `submit` - when the default "submit" button is clicked - if you override the default `completeButton` slot, this event won't be called
(example in Example.vue)    

  ```js
  function onSubmit(questionList) {
    // Handle submit event. 
  }
  ```

## Survey component slots:

* `complete` - Complete/submit screen content 
  * This is the content of your custom complete screen, by default the `thankYouText` language string is used,
  but you can customize this screen to look like you want
* `completeButton` - Complete/submit screen button
  * If you override the button, the `complete` event will not be called
  so you'll need to handle the button onClick event manually

## Submitting data:

* the `submit` event emits an event with the question list as the only parameter.
You can then send the data to your backend using `fetch` API or something like `Axios`.
If you've overriden the default `completeButton` slot, implement the `complete`
event to know when the user is in the complete screen and handle the rest manually.

##  Theming: 

* Create/change the theme of the application in the examples/*example-name*/branding.css. CSS variables support for legacy browsers is included.
* Enable dark mode support by using the `prefers-color-scheme` media query    

  ```css
  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
      /* dark mode styles go here */
  }
  ```
* You can further customize other aspects of the app for your particular needs in the src/assets/css
